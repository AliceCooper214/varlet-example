# Varlet-H5-Lite-Starter

This template should help get you started developing with Varlet UI Library. As a recommendation, we use Vue3 and TypeScript and Vite on this template. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Varlet UI

[Varlet](https://varlet.gitee.io/varlet-ui/#/en-US/home) is a Material design mobile component library developed based on Vue3, developed and maintained by partners in the community.

## Import On Demand

The on-demand import avoids the full import of components and can effectively reduce the size of the distribution package. The [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) will automatically import component logic and style files and use components.

## Auto Import APIs

[unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import)could help you create a global type declaration file so that you don't have to import vue APIs in every `.vue` file
