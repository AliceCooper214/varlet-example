# Varlet H5 Lite Starter

This template should help get you started developing with Varlet UI Library. 
As a recommendation, we use Vue3 and TypeScript and Vite on this template. 
The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs and `reactive transform`, 
check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) and [reactive transform docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-transform.html) to learn more.

## Features

### Varlet UI

[Varlet](https://varlet.gitee.io/varlet-ui/#/en-US/home) is a Material design mobile component library developed based on Vue3, developed and maintained by partners in the community.

### Import On Demand

The on-demand import avoids the full import of components and can effectively reduce the size of the distribution package. The [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) will automatically import component logic and style files and use components.
